# Python CLI Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of **Python CLI-based projects** demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and algorithms. These projects are excellent examples of how Python can be used for game development, problem-solving, and AI implementations. Below is a brief overview of each project included in this repository:

1. **Hangman**: A classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter.
2. **Markov Chain Composer**: A text generation tool that uses Markov chains to compose random sentences or paragraphs based on a given text.
3. **PyPhotoShop**: A simple image manipulation program providing basic functionalities like brightening, adjusting contrast, blurring and edge detection. You also need to install numpy for this
4. **Tic Tac Toe**: A classic Tic Tac Toe game including an unbeatable AI opponent.
5. **Binary Search**: An implementation of the binary search algorithm to efficiently find elements in a sorted list.
6. **Guess the Number**: A number guessing game with two modes: user guesses the computer's number, and the computer guesses the user's number.
7. **Madlibs**: A fun word game that generates a funny story based on user-provided words.
8. **Minesweeper**: A command-line version of the classic Minesweeper game where players uncover tiles while avoiding hidden mines.
9. **Rock Paper Scissors**: The classic hand game where players compete to outguess their opponent.
10. **Sudoku Solver**: A command-line based Sudoku solver that solves puzzles using backtracking algorithms.

## Installation
